### Warning

This bot is not currently Plug-and-Play.  She will not work if you clone this repository and run it straightaway; she has been built specifically for our server with no intention of sharing her code.  I am working on getting her in a state where that is a possibility, but she is nowhere near ready for that.

I am not available to be tech support or to help you get a bot working on your Discord server.  This is a pet project of a pet project.

The end state will be SoulBot, the bot with soul!  Her notable feature will be the soul folder, where all personality-related configuration will be stored.

In no particular order, and definitely not comprehensive
- [ ] Continue cleanup process
- [ ] Make a proper README
- [ ] Comments?  Maybe?
- [ ] Make as much of her moved into configuration files as possible
- [ ] Make a bash script that will ease setup and initialization
