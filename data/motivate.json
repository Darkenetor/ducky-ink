You don't just break into a gallop.  You gotta stretch first!  So just write anything to start stretching!"],

So don't give up!", "It doesn't matter how many other artists you think are 'better' than you, because they're not you.  They'll never be you.  So just be you because that's awesome and special!", "I'll put it on the fridge if you draw it!  :heart:"],

Exactly!", "I know you don't want to... but you really should, because you'll be really happy when it's done, and I want you to be happy.", "Do it for me?  Pretty please?", "I believe in you, and not just because I was told to say that.  I really do!"]
